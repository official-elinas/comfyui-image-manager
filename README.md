# comfyui-image-manager

A small application (inspired by [Hydrus](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus)) to load images in a directory that were generated by ComfyUI to preview in a gallery format

## Features
* Load a directory with ComfyUI images (may start a bit slow, or it's because I'm loading over a network share)
* Search for tags/metadata dynamically
* Bottom left image preview
* Open full size images
* Open file locations by right clicking in the gallery or pop up... and more to come.

Retrieves the following metadata:
* Prompt
* Negative Prompt
* Model
* Seed
* Steps
* Sampler
* Scheduler
* Denoise
* Upscaled Resolution
* Original Resolution

## Installation
You know the drill. Make a venv, activate it, and run `main.py`

## Extra Info
Note: `inspect_metadata.py` is a test script to pull the JSON metadata which was required to parse everything out correctly.

Credit: `image_parser.py` was adapted from the Discord bot [PI-Chan](https://github.com/yoinked-h/PI-Chan) but had modified to work with any workflow as my workflow was not being parsed correctly, neither with the bot. It also probably needs some optimization as well with the nested for loops, but I'll look into that later.
