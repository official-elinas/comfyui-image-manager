# comfyui-image-manager

A small application (inspired by [Hydrus](https://github.com/hydrusnetwork/hydrus)) to load images in a directory that were generated by ComfyUI to preview in a gallery format

## Features
* Load a directory with ComfyUI images
* Search for tags/metadata dynamically - both prompt and negative prompt.
* Open full size images in your system's image viewer (until I can solve the problem with non 1:1 images and centering)
* Open file locations by right clicking in the gallery... and more to come.

Retrieves the following metadata:
* Prompt
* Negative Prompt
* Model
* Seed
* Steps
* Sampler
* Scheduler
* Denoise
* Upscaled Resolution
* Original Resolution

## Installation
You know the drill. Make a venv, activate it, install requirements, and run `main.py`

## Extra Info
Note: `inspect_metadata.py` is a test script to pull the JSON metadata which was required to parse everything out correctly.

Credit: `image_parser.py` was adapted from the Discord bot [PI-Chan](https://github.com/yoinked-h/PI-Chan) but had modified to work with any workflow as my workflow was not being parsed correctly, neither with the bot. It also probably needs some optimization as well with the nested for loops, but I'll look into that later.
